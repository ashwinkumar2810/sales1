If you have one excel sheet. How would you convert data from a sheet into a table in Database.  Constraints - Code/solution should be reusable i.e. today table is user, after 10 days I might want to upload data from Customer Table and later from Employees. As long as Column names are matched between Excel and Db... It should Convert data . Order of Columns should not be important. Data Types match between Db and Excel should be bit flexible.    I have created a webpage using php in notepad ++ and have used xampp for server and the database was in SQL. The employ logins through his employid and password and then he has his sales data in excel sheet and he can upload the data which is in excel sheet and it gets stored in the sql database and he can view his data and can download it in the excel sheet.

The first page contains the user id and password field.
 
	On providing the user id and password the sales person is able to login into the page. On clicking submit button the page next page opens. It contains the sales form that can be filled up by the sales people. It also contains Employee Id at the top left corner of the page. The top right corner contains three options. The first is to Import the excel file. The second is to export the file and the third is to download the data format.
 
	On clicking import button, a window opens in which the sales people can upload the sales details.
 
	On clicking Export to excel, the sales people will be able to download the sales record for the individual.
